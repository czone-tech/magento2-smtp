Magento2 module for setting up and using SMTP mail

While Magento2 is a great e-commerce platform, there are a few additional features that it should have had out-of-the-box. 
SMTP mail is one such feature. In today's world, most websites rely upon SMTP mail servers for reliable and quick email delivery. Emails sent out using 'sendmail' will more or less find its way in the 'Trash' folder.

3. Open source- Use it as you want. Its completely open.
